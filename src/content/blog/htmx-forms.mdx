## Introduction

[HTMX](https://htmx.org/) is amazing! Working with it is a breeze but it does take a while getting used to it because if you're coming from React land! In this post, we'll see how to use HTMX and Zod to validate a simple Login form and send the correct errors back to the client. If you haven't seen my previous post yet, here is is: [TodoMVC with HTMX and Hyperscript - Part 1](https://ryan17.dev/blog/todomvc-htmx).

Here's the repo if you want to experiment and follow along: [HTMX Forms](https://github.com/ryands17/htmx-forms). You can think of HTMX as a server rendered app (SSR) where you send just HTML back to the browser and HTMX handles that using it's API. It can be best described as shown on the HTMX page:

import htmxIntro from '@/content/blog/images/htmx-intro.png';

<Image
  src={htmxIntro}
  alt="motivation behind creating HTMX"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>

What we'll do here is create a registration form with two fields, `email` and `password`. Let's create the base HTML that will be served by the main `/` endpoint:

<Code code={snippets.baseHtml} lang="tsx" showLineNumbers />

The above snippet uses the library `@kitajs/html` where we can write JSX so our components use props and are type-safe. We include the HTMX and Hyperscript scripts and some HTMX configuration in a script. We have the `children` prop and this is what we'll pass as children to this component:

<Code code={snippets.renderForm} lang="tsx" showLineNumbers />

We pass in the body with some [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) styles. Here the [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) library is being used so that we can easily create components without writing a lot of Tailwind classes. We want a card like structure in which we want to display a form with email and password fields. As we're using JSX and components, we create a `<RegistrationForm />` component that will render the form.

<Code code={snippets.registrationForm} lang="tsx" showLineNumbers />

We have a `form` here with two input fields. These input fields also contain errors displayed below that will be returned by the login API if we enter invalid credentials. These errors are given to us by Zod in the `/register` endpoint which checks if the email is a valid email and the password is at least 8 characters. This is how it looks like if we run our app and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

import registrationForm from '@/content/blog/images/registration-form.png';

<Image
  src={registrationForm}
  alt="The initial registration form with email and password fields"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>

## Submitting the form

Let's add some HTMX attributes on the form that will send a POST request to the `/register` endpoint. This will send the `email` and `password` fields in the body.

<Code code={snippets.submitForm} lang="tsx" />

Here's what these HTMX attributes do:

- `hx-post`: Send a POST request to the `/register` endpoint. We will be adding this below
- `hx-target`: Target the closest `div`, which is the one the encapsulates the form
- `hx-swap`: outerHTML is used to replace the entire `div` with the response from the `/register` endpoint

## The `/register` endpoint

Let's move on to writing this endpoint the form submits, but before that, let's create the [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schema for the body of the `/register` request:

<Code code={snippets.registerEndpoint} lang="ts" />

The above schema makes sure that the `email` field is a valid email and the password is at least 8 characters. We also add custom error messages if they are not. Now we can write the `/register` endpoint that uses the above schema and returns HTML (or in our case JSX). We need to check for two conditions:

- If the email and password are valid, show a success alert on the page instead of the form
- If either the email or password are invalid, show the correct error messages below the input fields

### The happy path

Starting with the first point, if the form values are valid, we show a success alert instead of the form like this:

<Code code={snippets.happyPath} lang="tsx" showLineNumbers />

We first parse the schema using Zod. We use `safeParse` here because we don't want Zod to throw if the schema is invalid and make sure we capture the errors. Zod gives us a union type based on the `success` boolean field. We check if the `success` field is **true** and if it is, we send the success alert saying **Registration Successful!**. Here's how it would look like:

import fieldsValid from '@/content/blog/images/fields-valid.png';

<Image
  src={fieldsValid}
  alt="fill the form with valid fields"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>

import registrationSuccessFul from '@/content/blog/images/registration-successful.png';

<Image
  src={registrationSuccessFul}
  alt="registration successful alert after submitting the form"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>

### The path of errors

That was the happy path. Now, let's check if the `result.success` field is **false** in the `else` block. What we will do here is parse error messages returned by Zod and return the same `<RegistrationForm />` component with the error messages below the inputs Zod gave us an error for.

<Code code={snippets.formErrors} lang="tsx" showLineNumbers />

In the above snippet, we map over the Zod errors and create an error object to pass in the `errors` prop to the `<RegistrationForm />` component. This is then checked and renderd in the following way:

<Code code={snippets.renderingErrors} lang="tsx" showLineNumbers />

We show the errors in the `<p />` tag and display them if they exist in the Zod errors object. On submitting a password with only 4 characters, our API will return the error for the password field and will look something like this:

import invalidPassword from '@/content/blog/images/invalid-password.png';

<Image
  src={invalidPassword}
  alt="Invalid password error shown below the password field"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>

We can see the error set below password field and it's the same we set in the registration Zod schema. We also added some height to the `<p />` tag so that there's no content layout shift when the error is shown.

## Conclusion

This is how we can perform form validation with HTMX and Zod. I will come up with more examples in the future with complex forms and error handling, but the concept is the same.
