summary: How can we install Husky in a subfolder where the parent folder is a git repository

import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import Code from '@/components/Code.astro';

## Introduction

This is a short post on how we can install [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) in a subfolder where the parent folder is a git repository. There are times when you only want hooks to run inside a single folder or even if you have folders with different projects/langauges.

The code for this can be found [here](https://github.com/ryands17/husky-subfolder) and you can follow the same steps as per your repository.

## Intial steps

We have a main repository here with two subfolders, `client` and `server` respectively. We want to install husky only in the `client` folder.

import folderStructure from '@/content/blog/images/folder-structure.png';

<Image
  src={folderStructure}

  height={500}
/>

Let's start with installing husky in the `client` folder using the command: `pnpm add -D husky`. I am using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) here but you can use a package manager of your choice.

## Initialising husky in the `client` folder

The next step is making sure husky is in the client folder only and also it should detect that we're in a `.git` repository. For this, let's create a `prepare` command that looks something like this:

<Code
  code={`{
  "prepare": "cd .. && husky ./client/.husky"
}`}
  lang="json"
  showLineNumbers
/>

This makes sure that husky recognises the `.git` folder in the parent and the hooks are installed in the `client` folder exactly like we want to.

I also have `prettier` and `lint-staged` installed as we will be running `lint-staged` in our **pre-commit** hook.

<Code
  code={`{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,css,md}": "prettier --write"
  },
  "prettier": {
    "singleQuote": true
  }
}`}
  lang="json"
  showLineNumbers
/>

## Creating the **pre-commit** hook

Finally, let's create the pre-commit hook in the `.husky` folder. To do this, just create a file named `pre-commit` and add the following command:

<Code code={`cd client && npx lint-staged`} showLineNumbers />

This makes sure that when the pre-commit hook runs from the parent folder, we enter in our `client` folder first and run `lint-staged` that runs prettier as the command to format all our staged files.

That's it! This should run on any subfolder that you setup in this way and not affect any other folders you have!
