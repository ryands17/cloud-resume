### A brief intro

I love creating Webapps and deploying them to the Cloud (AWS). My main area of expertise is in JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, React, GraphQL, Rust, and AWS, but love experimenting with new languages like Rust and orchestration systems like Kubernetes. I love creating architectures for various applications be it containers or serverless and follow the Well-Architected principles. I have worked with services like Lambda, ECS, EKS, Step Functions, SQS, AppSync etc. to create medium to large scale web apps.

In my spare time, I write blogs [here](https://ryan17.dev/blog/) and on [Dev Community](https://dev.to/ryands17/) on things like React, Node, Rust, and AWS. I hope to help others with these posts and this and contributing to open source is my way of giving back to the community.

This portfolio is deployed on a VM using [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) and Docker Compose. This is served via [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) with [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) as a CDN. You can find the source code for this [here](https://github.com/ryands17/cloud-resume).

### Things I do to keep myself sane

I love to play the Ukulele and I'm up for a jamming session! I also enjoy reading books/blogs especially about life, principles, and the world in general. I also love travelling, exploring cuisines of different places and cultures, and love cooking especially Indian and Italian ðŸ˜‹
