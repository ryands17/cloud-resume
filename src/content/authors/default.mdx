### A brief intro

I love creating Webapps and deploying them to the Cloud (AWS). My main area of expertise is in JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, React, GraphQL, and AWS, but love experimenting with new languages like Rust and orchestration systems like Kubernetes. I love the idea of Serverless so I always strive to implement Serverless solutions in every project and follow the Well-Architected principles. I have worked with services like Lambda, ECS, Step Functions, SQS, AppSync etc. to create medium/large scale WebApps.

In my spare time, I write blogs on [Dev Community](https://dev.to/ryands17/) on things like React, Node, and AWS. I hope to help others with these posts so that they get an easy way of doing the things that I experienced.

This portfolio is deployed on S3 served via CloudFront and all the resources are managed via [SST](https://docs.sst.dev/).

### Things I do to keep myself sane

I love to play the Ukulele and I'm up for a jamming session! I also enjoy reading books/blogs especially about life, principles, and the world in general. I also love travelling, exploring cuisines of different places and cultures and love cooking especially Indian and Italian ðŸ˜‹
